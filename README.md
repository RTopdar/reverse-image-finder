# Reverse Image Finder

This project aims to recreate the core functionalities and user interface of Pinterest, offering a visually appealing and user-friendly platform for discovering and sharing inspiring content. This tool will allow users to upload images of their choice, look at what others are uploading, and find similar images to cater to their interests and requirements.

Both the interface and image search algorithms are made entirely from scratch to give a fresh perspective on an image gallery that complies with the modern design standards.

Our goal is to showcase our abilities and build a user-facing web application using a seamless blend of different technologies.
